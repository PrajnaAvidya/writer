FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
caffeine hurry mechanic similar to jobs
prevent notification spam when buying tons of upgrades
more requirements for non-worker upgrades
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
- make it unlock different things than money
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
tutorial/tooltips
turn words into better/edited words
achievement currency/upgrades
- prestige once unlocking % of achievements & keep cheev currency
book releases (later game after contracts)
- based on reputation maybe?
- do we introduce a fans/readers currency? TBD
