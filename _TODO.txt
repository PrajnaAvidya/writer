core todo:
vuex -- periodic updates instead of every frame
save/load (+ autosave) using localforage
favicon
color scheme

misc todo:
strikethrough main word count when on job

ideas:
should job words be a separate currency?
recurring costs for hired people -- they quit if you can't pay them. or alternately they are "contractors" and only work for a certain amount of time (auto renew would be equivalent)
"assignment" system to get paid for short pieces in early game (to buy/hire stuff)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
job reward % based on quality level
quality for ideas too? (higher quality = more words)
- maybe start treating ideas as individual entities instead of a currency? is that too complex?

CURRENT: re-implementing workers
- ability/ui to assign workers to ideas vs words
- base producitivy + quality scores for ideas vs words
- accordion for slider view
