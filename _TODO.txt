CURRENT TODO:
upgrades
job cooldown ui
rework unfolding

CORE TODO:
stats
move more stuff to vuex
vuex -- periodic updates instead of every frame (what ive done with other games)
save/load (+ autosave) using localforage
color scheme -- art direction in general
grey out things player can't afford
google analytics/event tracking

IDEAS:
use tabs for nav
increase word value with word count (exponential counts) -- maybe could be an upgrade
more carrots for improvement (study early progression of games)
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
upgrades! (need some kind of store/new panel -- use $ or reputation? or both)
- maybe make the slider feature an upgrade
- player efficiency
recurring costs for workers
give coffee to children/workers

WORKERS TODO:
- idea vs word productivity stats
- accordion/expanding for slider/detail view

UPGRADES TODO:
click upgrades
buy upgrade
- check costs
- check requirements
apply upgrade in tick/click

FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
generate job data based on progress
intro/modal
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- minimum reputation for job completion
- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level (reputation, not money)
flavor texts/lore
tutorial/tooltips

GAME PROGRESSION IDEAS:
sell enough words to buy a coffee then show
get caffeine buzz up to X or money up to Y and show jobs
take on a couple jobs to afford hiring a child
unlock unlock students after X children
unlock upgrades after X students
