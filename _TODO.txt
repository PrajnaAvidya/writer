core todo:
vuex -- periodic updates instead of every frame
save/load (+ autosave) using localforage
favicon
color scheme

misc todo/fixes:
fix screen shifting from announcements

ideas:
recurring costs for hired people
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- workers can have word/idea quality stats
- job reward % based on quality level
- quality for ideas too? (higher quality = more words)
-- maybe start treating ideas as individual entities instead of a currency? is that too complex?
-- probably easier/better to have an efficiency stat instead (for player + workers)

future ideas/todo:
generate jobs based on current progress
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)

CURRENT: re-implementing workers
- idea->word efficiency stat. right now it's just 1 to 1.
- productivity/efficiency scores for ideas vs words
- accordion for slider view
