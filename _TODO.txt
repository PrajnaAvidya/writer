CORE TODO:
vuex -- periodic updates instead of every frame
save/load (+ autosave) using localforage
favicon
color scheme

MISC BUGS/FIXES:
stop screen shifting from announcements

FEATURE IDEAS:
more carrots for improvement (study early progression of games)
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
- lose by failing jobs
upgrades! (need some kind of store/new panel -- use $ or reputation? or both)
- maybe make the slider feature an upgrade
- player efficiency
recurring costs for workers
"scrap" button to start job over
- job time limits?

WORKERS TODO:
- idea vs word productivity stats
- word quality stats
- accordion for slider view

FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
generate jobs based on current progress
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- minimum reputation for job completion
- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level (reputation, not money)
- "scrap" button to start job over
-- job time limits?
"publish" feature to convert words into $/reputation
