MOVE ACTION ITEMS TO HACKNPLAN
replace word value/sell words with jobs system
- thresholds to various writing types ie novella vs novel vs epic & increase multiplier for longer
currently player should always sell the highest word count job because words have no other use
- need an interesting way to exchange words for money between jobs or else it will just be the player waiting 10 minutes for the next job so they can buy stuff (super boring)
-- short cooldowns for regular jobs (like 15-30 seconds to prevent spamming)
--- job-specific cooldowns
--- regenerate jobs if idle for cooldown length
--- show a progress bar/ui for cooldowns
-- urgent/special jobs that appear randomly & have a timer & better rewards

CORE TODO:
rework unfolding/progression
find more stats to track
art direction/color scheme
- consider ditching bulma
google analytics/event tracking
click animations

FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
make it possible to get going with <20 clicks
more requirements for non-worker upgrades
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
- make it unlock different things than money
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- minimum quality for job completion
- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level (reputation, not money)
tutorial/tooltips
turn words into better/edited words
achievement currency
- prestige once unlocking % of achievements & keep cheev currency

WRITING/LORE/INTRO TODO:
upgrade names/flavor texts
worker flavor texts
intro modal story
"tutorial job" with a 100 word count & fixed payout (enough for 3 workers?)

intro/story modal
click a few times
introduce caffeine
introduce jobs
introduce workers
introduce upgrades
