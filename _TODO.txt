MOVE ACTION ITEMS TO HACKNPLAN
change icon with writing upgrade
upgrade names & design to distinguish type by more than text

CORE TODO:
rework unfolding/progression
find more stats to track
art direction/color scheme
- consider ditching bulma
google analytics/event tracking
click animations
refactor stuff to watch property when better

FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
salvage some random clicker features
- particle/webgl effects
- anything else? the subreddit sim gimmick for flavor texts?
"motivate" workers by clicking them
click job bar for faster progress (upgrade -- cheeve currency?)
prevent notification spam when buying tons of upgrades
job slots as upgrades (randomize job lengths?)
reroll job as upgrade (with a cooldown)
more requirements for non-worker upgrades
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
- make it unlock different things than money
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- minimum quality for job completion
- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level (reputation, not money)
tutorial/tooltips
turn words into better/edited words
achievement currency/upgrades
- prestige once unlocking % of achievements & keep cheev currency
independent releases (later game after contracts)
- based on reputation maybe?
- do we introduce another fans/readers currency? TBD

WRITING/LORE/INTRO TODO:
upgrade names/flavor texts
worker flavor texts
intro modal story
"tutorial job" with a 100 word count & fixed payout (enough for 3 workers?)
