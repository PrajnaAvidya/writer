CURRENT TODO:
intro/modal
some kind of "sell words" feature to convert words into tiny amounts of $

CORE TODO:
vuex -- periodic updates instead of every frame
save/load (+ autosave) using localforage
color scheme -- art direction in general
grey out things player can't afford
global css for h tags and stuff
hide upgrades/workers at first
hide jobs/reputation at first

MISC BUGS/FIXES:


FEATURE IDEAS:
more carrots for improvement (study early progression of games)
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
- lose by failing jobs
upgrades! (need some kind of store/new panel -- use $ or reputation? or both)
- maybe make the slider feature an upgrade
- player efficiency
recurring costs for workers
"scrap" button to start job over
- job time limits?

WORKERS TODO:
- idea vs word productivity stats
- word quality stats
- accordion for slider view

UPGRADES TODO:
click upgrades
buy upgrade
- check costs
- check requirements
apply upgrade in tick/click

FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
generate jobs based on current progress
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- minimum reputation for job completion
- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level (reputation, not money)
- "scrap" button to start job over
-- job time limits?
flavor texts/lore
tutorial/tooltips

GAME PROGRESSION IDEAS:
jobs
workers
upgrades
TODO: selling words
