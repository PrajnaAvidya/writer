- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level (reputation, not money)
tutorial/tooltips
turn words into better/edited words
achievement currency/upgrades
- prestige once unlocking % of achievements & keep cheev currency

- do we introduce another fans/readers currency? TBD
