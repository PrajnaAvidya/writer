MISC BUGS/FIXES:
stop screen shifting from announcements

efficiency stat for idea->word conversion

upgrades! (need some kind of story -- use $?)
- maybe make the slider feature an upgrade
recurring costs for workers
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level

WORKERS TODO:
- idea vs word productivity stats
- word quality stats

generate jobs based on current progress
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
