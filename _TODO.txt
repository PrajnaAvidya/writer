move more stuff to vuex
vuex -- periodic updates instead of every frame (what ive done with other games)
save/load (+ autosave) using localforage
color scheme -- art direction in general
google analytics/event tracking
consider ditching buefy for home grown components
- consider ditching bulma completely once i start working on art/design
only show unmet upgrade requirements
click animations

FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
more requirements for non-worker upgrades
upgrades for job cooldown
use tabs for nav
increase word value with exponential word count -- could be an upgrade
more carrots for improvement (study early progression of games)
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
- make it unlock different things than money
recurring costs for workers
give coffee to children/workers
something that affects coffee cost (upgrade tradeoff?)
auto-drink coffee upgrade
generate job data based on progress
intro/modal
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- minimum reputation for job completion
- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level (reputation, not money)
tutorial/tooltips

WRITING/LORE TODO:
upgrade names/flavor texts
worker flavor texts
