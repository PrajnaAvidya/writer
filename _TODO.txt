periodic vuex updates
save/load (+ autosave) using localforage
figure out how to move "engine" outside of vue into an external js/module to reference

ideas:
money currency
"assignment" system to get paid for short pieces in early game (to buy/hire stuff)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
instead of production tiers being resource specific, allow player to assign them to ideas vs words
- maybe each tier has natural talents for each e.g. child is better at ideas, student is better at words
