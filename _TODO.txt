current jobs system is fucked because the carrot just keeps dangling further away when you dont accept or it regens.

worker/jobs/upgrade/cooldown/economy/etc balance
don't show higher level unbought upgrades
show wps per worker on grid next to % contribution
show caffeine buzz wps contribution on screen

CORE TODO:
rework unfolding/progression
art direction/design
google analytics/event tracking

FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
random popup rewards
- caffeine boost
- +words
- +money
- reset job cooldowns
caffeine hurry mechanic similar to jobs
prevent notification spam when buying tons of upgrades
more requirements for non-worker upgrades
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
- make it unlock different things than money
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
tutorial/tooltips
turn words into better/edited words
achievement currency/upgrades
- prestige once unlocking % of achievements & keep cheev currency
book releases (later game after contracts)
- based on reputation maybe?
- do we introduce a fans/readers currency? TBD

ACHIEVEMENT TODO:
notifications
currency name/values
show locked cheeves with ? on screen (and maybe a hint)
caffeine/job/words/money/wps/mps achievements

POTENTIAL CHEEVE CURRENCY UPGRADES:
job slots
job cooldown
"motivate" workers by clicking them
bar click multiplier
auto drink caffeine
caffeine affecting workers
"crit" feature for clicking
super caffeine

WRITING/LORE TODO:
upgrade names/flavor texts
worker flavor texts
intro modal story

EARLY PROGRESSION
intro/story modal

introduce caffeine
introduce jobs (show click to hurry)
