MOVE ACTION ITEMS TO HACKNPLAN
replace word value/sell words with jobs system
- thresholds to various writing types ie novella vs novel vs epic & increase multiplier for longer
refactor productivity vs efficiency -- remove one (thats why workers are currently OP)

CORE TODO:
rework unfolding/progression
find more stats to track
art direction/color scheme
- consider ditching bulma
google analytics/event tracking
click animations

FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
make it possible to get going with <20 clicks
more requirements for non-worker upgrades
use tabs for nav
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
- make it unlock different things than money
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- minimum quality for job completion
- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level (reputation, not money)
tutorial/tooltips

WRITING/LORE TODO:
