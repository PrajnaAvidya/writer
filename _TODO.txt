upgrade ui rework to distinguish type by more than text

CORE TODO:

find more stats to track
art direction/color scheme
google analytics/event tracking

FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
steal whatever good stuff is left from random clicker (subreddit sim flavor texts?)
prevent notification spam when buying tons of upgrades
more requirements for non-worker upgrades
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
- make it unlock different things than money
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- minimum quality for job completion
- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level (reputation, not money)
tutorial/tooltips
turn words into better/edited words
achievement currency/upgrades
- prestige once unlocking % of achievements & keep cheev currency
independent releases (later game after contracts)
- based on reputation maybe?
- do we introduce another fans/readers currency? TBD
