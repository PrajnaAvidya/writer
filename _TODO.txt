core todo:
vuex -- periodic updates instead of every frame
save/load (+ autosave) using localforage
favicon

ideas:
recurring costs for hired people -- they quit if you can't pay them. or alternately they are "contractors" and only work for a certain amount of time.
"assignment" system to get paid for short pieces in early game (to buy/hire stuff)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
instead of production tiers being resource specific, allow player to assign them to ideas vs words
- maybe each tier has natural talents for each e.g. child is better at ideas, student is better at words
