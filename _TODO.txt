MOVE ACTION ITEMS TO HACKNPLAN

CORE TODO:
rework unfolding/progression
find more stats to track
art direction/color scheme
google analytics/event tracking
consider ditching buefy for homegrown components
- consider ditching bulma completely once i start working on art/design
click animations

FUTURE IDEAS/TODO:
more requirements for non-worker upgrades
use tabs for nav
increase word value with exponential word count -- could be an upgrade
reputation currency
- get from finishing jobs -- more quality = more reputation
- make it unlock different things than money
something that affects coffee cost (upgrade tradeoff?)
intro/modal
a polynomial growth worker (ie someone who hires students, and then someone/something that increases that)
some sort of quality/creativity average for words written
- minimum quality for job completion
- player + workers (and upgradeable for both)
- job reward % based on quality level (reputation, not money)
tutorial/tooltips
sell % of words instead of all

WRITING/LORE TODO:
upgrade names/flavor texts
worker flavor texts
